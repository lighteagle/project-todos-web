# Project Todos Web

Todos is a simple application to store and manage our todos, tasks, or activities. Just like Google Keep, Google Tasks, or generic todos app.

A complete Todos app should able to:

- See a blank page if there is no todos
- Show all todos if there is a data
- Save or store todos, tasks, or activities
- Each todo can contains id, text, favorite label, date of creation, tags, etc
- Search or filter todos based on variety of parameters
- Add new todo data
- Remove one specific todo
- Remove all todos
- Update each todo's data
